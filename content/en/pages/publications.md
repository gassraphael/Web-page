- **AlphaPEM: An Open-Source Dynamic 1D Physics-Based Pem Fuel Cell Model for Embedded Applications** (1st author)
    - In the [SoftwareX](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.102002) journal, in [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12373), in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04647829) or in [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=4946674) (postprint).
    - The objective of this work is to highlight the AlphaPEM software, which has been published as open-source on GitHub. The first version of this PEM fuel cell simulator is based on the dynamic 1D model developed during my PhD. 

- **An Advanced 1D Physics-Based Model for PEM Hydrogen Fuel Cells With Enhanced Overvoltage Prediction** (1st author)
	- In the [International Journal of Hydrogen Energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.11.374), in [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07508), in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04530852) or in [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4812343) (postprint).
	- The aim of this study was to introduce the dynamic 1D model developed during my PhD, emphasizing the adjustment of the equations for this specific model and their numerical resolution. Furthermore, a novel coefficient is proposed to establish a physical relationship between the voltage drop at high currents, the quantity of liquid water in the cell, and operating conditions.

- **A Critical Review of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Matter Transports and Voltage Polarisation for Modelling** (1st author)
	- In the [Journal of the Electrochemical Society](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad305a), in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13323) or in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04493419) (postprint).
	- The aim of this work was to compile, within a single article, all the equations required for the physical modeling of a fuel cell. Each equation is complemented with explanations, critical analysis, and suggestions for potential enhancements.

# Published thesis manuscript (2024)
- **Advanced physical modeling of PEM fuel cells to enhance their performances** (1st author)
		- In [HAL](https://hal.science/tel-04923016) (final version).
		- The objective of this thesis was to develop an advanced model for PEMFCs to optimize their control and improve performance. A 1D, dynamic, two-phase, isothermal model was proposed, leading to the development of the open-source software AlphaPEM, which enables accurate simulations and facilitates predictive control strategies for enhanced fuel cell operation.
