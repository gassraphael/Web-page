# Published open-source software
- **AlphaPEM** (1st author)
    - Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gassraphael/AlphaPEM).
    - This PEM fuel cell simulator, developed from research, aims to improve the real-time control of these converters in order to enhance their performance and lifespan. The software is designed to be collaborative, ensuring its development is as robust and rapid as possible. Any partnerships are therefore welcome.	
	
# Submitted journal papers
- **AlphaPEM: An Open-Source Dynamic 1D Physics-Based Pem Fuel Cell Model for Embedded Applications** (1st author)
    - In the journal SoftwareX, in [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12373), in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04647829) or in [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=4946674) (preprint).
    - The objective of this work is to highlight the AlphaPEM software, which has been published as open-source on GitHub. The first version of this PEM fuel cell simulator is based on the dynamic 1D model developed during my PhD. 

- **An Advanced 1D Physics-Based Model for PEM Hydrogen Fuel Cells With Enhanced Overvoltage Prediction** (1st author)
	- In the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, in [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07508) or in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04530852) (preprint).
	- The aim of this study was to introduce the dynamic 1D model developed during my PhD, emphasizing the adjustment of the equations for this specific model and their numerical resolution. Furthermore, a novel coefficient is proposed to establish a physical relationship between the voltage drop at high currents, the quantity of liquid water in the cell, and operating conditions.
	
# Published journal papers
## 2024
- **A Critical Review of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Matter Transports and Voltage Polarisation for Modelling** (1st author)
	- In the [Journal of the Electrochemical Society](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad305a) or in [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04493419) (postprint).
	- The aim of this work was to compile, within a single article, all the equations required for the physical modeling of a fuel cell. Each equation is complemented with explanations, critical analysis, and suggestions for potential enhancements.
